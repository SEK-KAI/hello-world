Just the tutorial repository from GitHub


Hello

I'm using GitHub as a place to learn to program as well as share any projects I may come up with. 
Right now I focus mostly on learning Processing, as I am a designer and artist. I hope to gain more experience
with other languages as I see fit, but I'm excited to be a part of this world we know as computer science.
